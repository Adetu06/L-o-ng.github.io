Content looks interseting. Subjects are diverse and every page has some level of information.

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation
The visuals are consistent throughout all pages

## Quality of written presentation
It's good. Let's be honest, none of us had the time to do more so whats the point in blasting you for not writing more???

## Validity of HTML
Yes, good

## Evidence of collaboration including
We don't see multiple branches. We see only 2 commits? Thats some suspicious stuff
